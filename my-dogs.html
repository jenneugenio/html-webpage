  <h1>Spark and Koda</h1>
  <p>I love my pups, Spark and Koda. Spark is 4 years old and Koda is 3 years old. We got both of them from Craigslist and although they aren't rescues, we feel as if they were because their previous owners did not take care of them like we do.</p>
  <p> They are both chihuahua terriers and fairly small.</p>
